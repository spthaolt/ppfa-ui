# PPFA UI Framework

## About this framework

This is the PPFA-UI frontend framework, which will be applied across all PPFA surveys to ensure uniformity across systems developed for Planned Parenthood.  This is a unique framework based off of [Flat UI Free](http://designmodo.github.io/Flat-UI/) and [Twitter Bootstrap 3](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap).

The goal is to have the same CSS and JS applied to every front-end build delivered to PPFA, ensuring common styling and functionality.  This offers several advantages:
+ Uniformity for developers and users
+ Faster design and development times
+ Single project to debug/maintain/distribute


## Intended use

The PPFA-UI Framework should be applied to every solution build and should function like frameworks familiar to developers (Bootstrap, Foundation, etc.)  Like these examples; we should plug in the CSS, plug in the JS, then pick and choose what is applied to individual surveys, tempaltes and pages.  Like Boostrap, a dev may not apply a slider on every page, but it's easy to plug in and play as required.


## Goal

Master design and coding of all UI elements (typography, icons, buttons, dropdowns, calendars, tabs, etc, etc...) maintained in this repo and fully cross-browser tested _before_ being added to any existing survery build.

Since this will be applied on top of SharePoint, collaboration is required from all devs.  SharePoint-specific cases should be clearly commented in the code.

The important difference in thinking is understanding PPFA as a whole project, rather than individual systems.  The more time that is invested in this framework build will make things so much easier in future builds (across all company projects).  To make this as useful as it can be, all contributions should adopt best practices and effecient coding.
